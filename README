Notes:
    Several functions, or parts of functions, were copied from samples
    provided in the lecture files. When this code has been used, a note on the
    source appears in the function comments. Any modifications were made by me.
    
    I wrote my code using a combination of BBEdit on the Mac, and server-side
    editing using Emacs. Indentation is 4-space wide tabs. Before submission,
    I ran the Emacs command 'M-x untabify' to convert tabs to spaces.
